# ==Integer Type

## ==1. Definition
An integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers.

## ==2. Example
Examples of integers include 21, 4, 0, and -2048.

## ==3. Implementation
Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits (bits).

## ==4. Signed and Unsigned Types
Integral types may be unsigned (capable of representing only non-negative integers) or signed (capable of representing negative integers as well).

## ==5. Different Sizes
Integral data types may be of different sizes. The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers.

## ==6. Value and Representation
The value of an item with an integral type is the mathematical integer that it corresponds to. The internal representation of this datum is the way the value is stored in the computer's memory.

## ==7. Width or Precision
The width or precision of an integral type is the number of bits in its representation.

## ==8. Encoding
Other encodings of integer values to bit patterns are sometimes used, for example binary-coded decimal or Gray code, or as printed character codes such as ASCII.

## ==9. Signed Number Representations
There are four well-known ways to represent signed numbers in a binary computing system. The most common is two's complement.
