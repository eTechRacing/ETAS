# ==Floating Point Type

## ==1. Definition
Floating-point arithmetic represents subsets of real numbers using an integer with a fixed precision, called the significant, scaled by an integer exponent of a fixed base.

## ==2. Example
For example, the floating-point number 12.345 is represented in the floating-point format as follows: ...

## ==3. Implementation
The implementation of floating-point numbers involves two main components: the significand (also known as the mantissa) and the exponent.

## ==4. Different Sizes
Floating-point numbers come in different sizes, such as single-precision and double-precision.

## ==5. IEEE Standard
The IEEE 754 Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic is the most commonly encountered representation.

## ==6. Operations
Floating-point arithmetic operations, such as addition and division, approximate the corresponding real number arithmetic operations.

## ==7. Applications
Floating-point arithmetic is used in representing very small and very large real numbers that require fast processing times.

## ==8. Limitations
The numbers that can be represented by floating-point are not uniformly spaced.

## ==9. Floating-Point Unit (FPU)
The Floating-Point Unit (FPU) is a part of a computer system specially designed to carry out operations on floating-point numbers.
