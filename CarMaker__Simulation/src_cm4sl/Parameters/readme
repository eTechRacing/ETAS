Readme: DRS example

Data:
Lookuptable of values for c_D, c_L, c_S with 2 columns (DRS off(0) /on(1) ), stored in matrices AeroFL.mat, AeroFD.mat, AeroFS.mat. Have to be loaded into workspace before running Simulink model.
For variant B: AeroFLB.mat, AeroFDB.mat, AeroFSB.mat

Usage of DRS (in CarMaker):
Flag to change DRS position: DRS.Switch; 0=Full Drag, 1= Reduced Drag

Minimaneuver Command 	to activate DRS:	DVAwr DRS.Switch Abs -1 1 
			to deactivate:		DVAwr DRS.Switch Abs -1 0


Limitations:
-Vertical Wind speed (relative to vehicle) NOT taken into account for calculation of forces.
-Can be extended to more DRS positions (e.g. quarter, half, 3/4) etc.
-Values for c_D,c_L, c_S are just estimated and do not necessarily depict reality. We are happy about contributions of more realistic values.
-In this example, only the drag coefficient changes when DRS is switched on. To model effects on lift and side force, please add your own values into the corresponding tables (AeroFL.mat, AeroFS.mat)


Variant A: (complete aerodynamic table (for the car) must be known for the different positions of the DRS)

	Aerodynamic forces replaced by user model's values, generated from a model similar to the model in CarMaker (see Reference Manual p.203 Section 13.1).
	
	Limitations:
	-Can be extended to aerodynamic torques in a similar way.
	-The aerodynamic forces act on the reference point, which can be set up in the GUI (only pre-Simulation, then static for this simulation run).

Variant B: (Additional forces (and their point of attac) generated by active DRS must be known as well as the normal (DRS off) aerodynamic properties (regular CM aeroydynamics model))

	Aerodynamic forces and torques generated by CarMaker's model, only the delta/differences which are generated by the active DRS are applied additionally as Virtual Forces.
	Virtual Forces are applied at the Virtual Point of Attack, it is set by default (in this model, may be changed at will) to the reference point of the Aerodynamics

	Advantage: Easier to measure (?), variable point of attack  (changeable at runtime).
	Disadvantage: Additional source of errors, especially in analyis via IPGControl: Keep in mind to add Aero Forces and Virtual Forces.

	Limitations:
	-Adjustments need to be made, if flexible car model is used. (Point of Attack has different variable name, see Reference Manual
	-realistic values/algorithm for additional forces needs to be implemented. currently: static lookup table, only for Drag, with current configuration no change in lift,sideforce, when DRS is activated
